The program is intended to be a stand alone application that can be used in a Visual Effect Pipeline. It utilize the FBX SDK to parse the scene file, and CGAL for computing the voronoi diagrams.

Feature : Voronoi based shatter effects for offline/realtime rendering. FBX SDK enable to read from and write to different 3D package such as Maya, 3D Max, Softimage and Houdini.
